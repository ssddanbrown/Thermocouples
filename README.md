# Thermocouples

Thermocouples app for android. Provides basic information for thermocouples as well as calculations and color searching.

This application was my first coding project ever so the code quality isn't great but I've been making small improvements over the years and it seems to run pretty solidly.
The app targets the latest version of android and is backwards compatible down to 4.0.

This application can be found on the play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.southerntemp.thermocouples).
